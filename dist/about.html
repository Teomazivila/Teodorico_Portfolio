          <p>
            * The DevOps methodology is a set of practices that require the collaboration of development and 
            operations teams throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 
            It incorporates Agile practices and focuses on breaking down team silos, 
            automating manual tasks, and increasing productivity through continuous feedback. 
            <h5 style="color: #7a7c12;">* Continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD), Cloud-based pipelines 
            Microservices, and Infrastructure as code (IaaC)</h5>
            * The DevOps Process include: Plan -> at the beginning of a project, sprint/iteration, or day, work 
            is planned and prioritized. This helps ensure that all team members understand current goals and defines 
            what work is expected.
            <br />* Code -> Developers create and submit code changes or additions that meet the tasks defined for the 
            current iteration. These are based on a master code base that all developers have access to. 
            This step also includes code review and any clarifications or adjustments that are needed. 
            When submitted code fails to pass testing, it is returned to this step for modification 
            <br />*
            Build -> submitted code is compiled, unit tested, and packaged. This is generally the first automated step in the CI/CD pipeline. 
            If a build fails, feedback is sent to the developer, and the submitted change is rejected. 
            If the build is successful, it is passed on for additional testing 
            <br />* Test -> Successful builds are passed through a series of tests to ensure functionality, quality, and often security. 
            Ideally, the fastest or most critical tests are performed first.
            <h5 style="color: #17a2b8;"> Deliver -> The last passing build is maintained and held for deployment. </h5>
             <br />* Deploy -> A build may be deployed to a test environment for additional testing, such as user acceptance. 
             Or, it can be delivered to staging or production environments for release. 
             <br />* Monitor -> After release, versions are monitored to identify any issues that were missed and to gather use data that can be applied to future improvements.
